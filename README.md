# HEANPcalculator
> The script implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for calculating the free energy of multielement alloys. Users can select elements from the periodic table, input atomic percentages, and specify a reaction temperature. The program calculates mixing enthalpy, mixing entropy, delta parameters, and free energy using binary enthalpy databases (Takeuchi and Troparevsky).  
>  
> **Software and Dependencies**  
> The code is written in Python 3.9 and requires the following libraries: `tkinter`, `pandas`, and `numpy`. A `requirements.txt` file is included in the repository for easy installation of dependencies.  
>  
> **Instructions for Running the Code**  
> To run the code, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Execute the script using `python alloy_free_energy_calculator.py`. Use the GUI to select elements, input atomic percentages, and calculate the desired properties.
